<h1>A calendar of University of Kent week numbers</h1>
<p>I live by my organisers, e.g. the calendar on my desktop, iCal, and that on my
PDA (e.g. iPhone and before that Palm) rather than the Kent paper diary. The diary has 
  (at least) one advantage however: it specifies the week numbers. I have long 
  found it a pain to enter all of these by hand into my organiser. So I've written 
  a little Perl <a href="events.pl">script</a> to generate a set of regularly 
  spaced dates (e.g. the week number on the Monday of every week) into a format that can then be 
  imported into a calendar. It supports two formats: vCal
  (<code>.vcs</code>,<code>.ics</code>) which is widely used,
  and a legacy (?) format that can be converted into datebook <code>.dba</code>
  (which I needed when I used the Palm Desktop on Windows).

<p>Here's the weeks for 
  <a href="terms.ics">this academic year</a> in vCal/ics format, ready to be
  imported into your calendar.  Each week is represented by an all-day event on Monday.

<h2>DIY</h2>

<p>To do this yourself, you'll need (1) Perl. If you use a Mac, Google calendar
  or (I think) most modern Windows calendars, that's it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Windows users with Palm organisers (does anyone still use these?) 
  will need (2) a little DOS tool called 
  convdb. I got a copy from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Way/4696/">here</a>. 
  It's a pretty flexible if rather fragile tool for converting from plain text 
  to the Palm .dba format.
  As an example, here's the  
  <a href="ukc0607.dba">terms 2006/07</a> in datebook .dba format.</p>
  </p>
</blockquote>
  
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><code>events.pl [-h] [-v|d] [-l label] [-p period] [-s start] day/month/year repeat...</code><br>
  events.pl expects groups of pairs of arguments. It will generate a list of dates 
  for each group, starting with the date given and repeated <code>repeat</code> 
  times, using a period of <code>period</code> days. 
  
<h3> Options:</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-h</code></td>
    <td>Print this message and exit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-v</code></td>
    <td>Use vcal format (default).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-d</code></td>
    <td>Use dba format.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-l label</code></td>
    <td>Print each event as &quot;label <em>N</em>&quot; where <em>N</em> is the 
      number of the event. Default: &quot;Kent Week&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-p period</code></td>
    <td>The repeat period in days. Default: 7.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>-s start</code></td>
    <td>The starting number for the label. Default: 1.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>First, generate the dates in vcal format. E.g.
<p><code>events.pl 24/9/2007 12 14/1/2008 12 5/5/2008 6 &gt; ukc0708.ics</code>
<p>will produce a list in plain text for the the three terms of Kent 2007/8 academic year. 
<p>Then, import it to your calendar.</p>
<p><em>Technical Note</em>:
There's little difference between .vcs and .ics files, at least as far as
generating week dates is concerned.
The <code>.ics</code> format should specify <code>VERSION:2.0</code> whereas 
<code>.vcs</code> should specify <code>VERSION:1.0</code>.
My code generates  <code>VERSION:2.0</code>.
However, I find that importing a file with an <code>.ics</code> extension into Mac OS Calendar
"works", i.e. events appear in the all-day section of the calendar, whereas
importing a file with an <code>.vcs</code> extension does not, regardless of the
<code>VERSION</code>: the event appears as literally all day.

<h3>Windows for Palm example</h3>
<p>First, generate a plain text list of dates in a format convdb can read. E.g. 
<p><code>events.pl 24/9/2007 12 14/1/2008 12 5/5/2008 6 &gt; ukc0708.txt</code></p>
<p>will produce a list in plain text for the the three terms of Kent 2007/8 academic year. 
<p>You then need to convert it to .dba format with convdb; the .dba file 
  will be called <code>output.dba</code>. 
<p>Finally, rename output.dba to something sensible, e.g. <code>ukc0708.dba</code> and 
  import it to your organiser (e.g. via the Palm desktop).</p>
  
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>It would be nice if convdb was translated to something portable, e.g. Perl.</p>
