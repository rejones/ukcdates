<h1>UKC dates for the Palm datebook</h1>
<p>I live by their Palm organiser rather than the UKC paper diary. The diary has 
  (at least) one advantage however: it specifies the week numbers. I have long 
  found it a pain to enter all of these by hand into my organiser. So I've written 
  a little Perl <a href="events.pl">script</a> to generate a set of regularly 
  spaced dates (e.g. the dates of week starts) into a format that can then be 
  converted into datebook .dba format. Here's the weeks for the
  <a href="ukc0607.dba">terms 2006/07</a> in datebook .dba format.</p>
  
<p>To do this yourself, you'll need (1) Perl and (2) a little DOS tool called 
  convdb. I got a copy from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Way/4696/">here</a>. 
  It's a pretty flexible if rather fragile tool for converting from plain text 
  to the Palm .dba format.</p>
  
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><code>events.pl [-h] [-l label] [-p period] [-s start] day/month/year repeat...</code><br>
  events.pl expects groups of pairs of arguments. It will generate a list of dates 
  for each group, starting with the date given and repeated <code>repeat</code> 
  times. 
  
<h3> Options:</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-h</code></td>
    <td>Print this message and exit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-l label</code></td>
    <td>Print each event as &quot;label <em>N</em>&quot; where <em>N</em> is the 
      number of the event.Default: &quot;UKC Week&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>-p period</code></td>
    <td>The repeat period. Default: 7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>-s start</code></td>
    <td>The starting number for the label. Default: 1.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Example</h3>
First, generate a plain text listof dates in a format convdb can read. E.g. 
<p><code>events.pl 26/9/2005 12 9/1/2006 12 1/5/2006 6 &gt; ukc0506.txt</code></p>
<p>will produce a list in plain text for the the three terms of 2005/6 academic 
  year. You then need to convert it to .dba format with convdb; the .dba file 
  will be called <code>output.dba</code>. (Yes, I know the Summer Term actually 
  starts on 2/5/2006 but that's a Tuesday). 
  <p>Rename output.dba to something sensible, e.g. <code>ukc0506.dba</code> and 
  import it to your organiser (e.g. via the Palm desktop).</p>
  
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>It would be nice if convdb was translated to something portable, e.g. Perl.</p>
